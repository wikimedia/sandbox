<p>To understand how Gerrit works, let&#8217;s follow a change through its entire
life cycle. This example uses a Gerrit server configured as follows:</p>

<h2 id="_making_the_change">Making the Change</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our first developer, Max, has decided to make a change to the RecipeBook
project he works on. His first step is to get the source code that he wants to
modify. To get this code, he runs the following <code>git clone</code> command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git clone ssh://gerrithost:29418/RecipeBook.git RecipeBook</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After he clones the repository, he runs a couple of commands to add a
<a href="user-changeid.html">Change-Id</a> to his commits. This ID allows Gerrit to link
together different versions of the same change being reviewed.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="_creating_the_review">Creating the Review</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Max&#8217;s next step is to push his change to Gerrit so other contributors can review
it. He does this using the <code>git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master</code> command, as
follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ &lt;work&gt;

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice the reference to a <code>refs/for/master</code> branch. Gerrit uses this branch to
create reviews for the master branch. If Max opted to push to a different
branch, he would have modified his command to
<code>git push origin HEAD:refs/for/&lt;branch_name&gt;</code>. Gerrit accepts pushes to
<code>refs/for/&lt;branch_name&gt;</code> for every branch that it tracks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The output of this command also contains a link to a web page Max can use to
review this commit. Clicking on that link takes him to a screen similar to
the following.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 1. Gerrit Code Review Screen</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the Gerrit code review screen, where other contributors can review
his change. Max can also perform tasks such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Looking at the <a href="user-review-ui.html#diff-preferences">diff</a> of his change</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s now switch to Hannah, the senior developer who will review Max&#8217;s change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned previously, Max chose to manually add Hannah as a reviewer. Gerrit
offers other ways for reviewers to find changes, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using the <a href="user-search.html">search</a> feature that to find changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selecting <strong>Open</strong> from the <strong>Changes</strong> menu</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting up <a href="user-notify.html">email notifications</a> to stay informed of
changes even if you are not added as a reviewer</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because Max added Hannah as a reviewer, she receives an email telling her about
his change. She opens up the Gerrit code review screen and selects Max&#8217;s change.</p>

             * Verified</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These two lines indicate what checks must be completed before the change is
accepted. The default Gerrit workflow requires two checks:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Code-Review</strong>. This check requires that someone look at the code and ensures
that it meets project guidelines, styles, and other criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verified</strong>. This check means that the code actually compiles, passes any unit
tests, and performs as expected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, the <strong>Code-Review</strong> check requires an individual to look at the code,
while the <strong>Verified</strong> check is done by an automated build server, through a
mechanism such as the
<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Trigger" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gerrit Trigger</a>.</p>

The Code-Review and Verified checks require different permissions

<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the code review screen open, Hannah can begin to review Max&#8217;s change. She
can choose one of two ways to review the change: unified or side-by-side.
Both views allow her to perform tasks such as add

<a href="user-review-ui.html#reply">summary</a> comments.</p>

<p><code>+2 Looks good to me, approved</code></p>

check. It has to pass one more check before it can be accepted: the <strong>Needs
Verified</strong> check.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Verified check means that the change was confirmed to work. This type of
check typically involves tasks such as checking that the code compiles, unit
tests pass, and other actions. You can configure a Verified check to consist
of as many or as few tasks as needed.</p>

<p>Verification is typically an automated process using the
<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Trigger" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gerrit Trigger Jenkins Plugin</a>
or a similar mechanism. However, there are still times when a change requires
manual verification, or a reviewer needs to check how or if a change works.
To accommodate these and other similar circumstances, Gerrit exposes each change
as a git branch. The Gerrit UI includes a
<a href="user-review-us.html#download"><strong>download</strong></a> link in the Gerrit Code Review
Screen to make it easy for reviewers to fetch a branch for a specific change.
To manually verify a change, a reviewer must have the
<a href="config-labels.html#label_Verified">Verified</a> permission. Then, the reviewer
can fetch and checkout that branch from Gerrit. Hannah has this permission, so
she is authorized to manually verify Max&#8217;s change.</p>
