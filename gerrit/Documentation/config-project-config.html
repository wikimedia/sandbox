<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This page explains the storage format of Gerrit&#8217;s project configuration
and access control models.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The web UI access control panel is a front end for human-readable
configuration files under the refs/meta/config namespace in the
affected project.  Direct manipulation of these files is mainly
relevant in an automation scenario of the access controls.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_refsmetaconfig_namespace">The refs/meta/config namespace</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The namespace contains three different files that play different
roles in the permission model.  With read permission to that reference,
it is possible to fetch the refs/meta/config reference to a local
repository.  A nice side effect is that you can also upload changes
to project permissions and review them just like with regular code
changes. The preview changes option is also provided on the UI. Please note
that you will have to configure push rights for the refs/meta/config name
space if you&#8217;d like to use the possibility to automate permission updates.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_property_inheritance">Property inheritance</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a property is set to INHERIT, then the value from the parent project is
used. If the property is not set in any parent project, the default value is
FALSE.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="file-project_config">The file project.config</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The project.config file contains the link between groups and their
permitted actions on reference patterns in this project and any projects
that inherit its permissions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The format in this file corresponds to the Git config file format, so
if you want to automate your permissions it is a good idea to use the
git config command when writing to the file. This way you know you
don&#8217;t accidentally break the format of the file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here follows a git config command example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git config -f project.config project.description "Rights inherited by all other projects"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below you will find an example of the project.config file format:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>[project]
       description = Rights inherited by all other projects
[access "refs/*"]
       read = group Administrators
[access "refs/heads/*"]
        label-Your-Label-Here = -1..+1 group Administrators
[capability]
       administrateServer = group Administrators
[receive]
       requireContributorAgreement = false
[label "Your-Label-Here"]
        function = MaxWithBlock
        value = -1 Your -1 Description
        value =  0 Your No score Description
        value = +1 Your +1 Description</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, there are several sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="#project-section">project section</a> appears once per project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="#access-section">access section</a> appears once per reference pattern,
such as <code>refs/*</code> or <code>refs/heads/*</code>.  Only one access section per pattern is
allowed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="#receive-section">receive section</a> appears once per project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="#submit-section">submit section</a> appears once per project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="#capability-section">capability</a> section only appears once, and only
in the All-Projects repository.  It controls core features that are configured
on a global level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="#label-section">label</a> section can appear multiple times. You can
also redefine the text and behavior of the built in label types <code>Code-Review</code>
and <code>Verified</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Optionally a commentlink section can be added to define project-specific
comment links. The commentlink section has the same format as the
<a href="config-gerrit.html#commentlink">commentlink section in gerrit.config</a>
which is used to define global comment links.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="project-section">Project section</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The project section includes configuration of project settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are the keys:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a id="description"></a>description</dt>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A description for the project.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a id="state"></a>state</dt>
<dd>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This setting defines the state of the project. A project can have the
following states:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Active</code>:</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The project is active and users can see and modify the project according
to their access rights on the project.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Read Only</code>:</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The project is read only and all modifying operations on it are
disabled. E.g. this means that pushing to this project fails for all
users even if they have push permissions assigned on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Setting a project to this state is an easy way to temporary close a
project, as you can keep all write access rights in place and they will
become active again as soon as the project state is set back to
<code>Active</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This state also makes sense if a project was moved to another location.
In this case all new development should happen in the new project and
you want to prevent that somebody accidentally works on the old
project, while keeping the old project around for old references.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Hidden</code>:</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The project is hidden and only visible to project owners. Other users
are not able to see the project even if they have read permissions
granted on the project.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="receive-section">Receive section</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The receive section includes configuration of project-specific
receive settings:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a id="receive.requireContributorAgreement"></a>receive.requireContributorAgreement</dt>
<dd>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Controls whether or not a user must complete a contributor agreement before
they can upload changes. Default is <code>INHERIT</code>. If <code>All-Project</code> enables this
option then the dependent project must set it to false if users are not
required to sign a contributor agreement prior to submitting changes for that
specific project. To use that feature the global option in <code>gerrit.config</code>
must be enabled:
<a href="config-gerrit.html#auth.contributorAgreements">auth.contributorAgreements</a>.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a id="receive.requireSignedOffBy"></a>receive.requireSignedOffBy</dt>
<dd>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sign-off can be a requirement for some projects (for example Linux kernel uses
it). Sign-off is a line at the end of the commit message which certifies who
is the author of the commit. Its main purpose is to improve tracking of who
did  what, especially with patches. Default is <code>INHERIT</code>, which means that this
property is inherited from the parent project.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a id="receive.requireChangeId"></a>receive.requireChangeId</dt>
<dd>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Require Change-Id in commit message</code> option defines whether a
<a href="user-changeid.html">Change-Id</a> in the commit message is required
for pushing a commit for review. If this option is set, trying to push
a commit for review that doesn&#8217;t contain a Change-Id in the commit
message fails with <a href="error-missing-changeid.html">missing Change-Id
in commit message footer</a>.</p>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is recommended to set this option and use a
<a href="user-changeid.html#create">commit-msg hook</a> (or other client side
tooling like EGit) to automatically generate Change-Id&#8217;s for new
commits. This way the Change-Id is automatically in place when changes
are reworked or rebased and uploading new patch sets gets easy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If this option is not set, commits can be uploaded without a Change-Id,
but then users have to remember to copy the assigned Change-Id from the
change screen and insert it manually into the commit message when they
want to upload a second patch set.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Default is <code>INHERIT</code>, which means that this property is inherited from
the parent project. The global default for new hosts is <code>true</code></p>

is larger than the given size the pack-parsing will abort and the push
operation will fail. If set to zero then there is no limit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project owners can use this setting to prevent developers from pushing
objects which are too large to Gerrit. This setting can also be set in
<code>gerrit.config</code> globally (<a href="config-gerrit.html#receive.maxObjectSizeLimit">
receive.maxObjectSizeLimit</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The project specific setting in <code>project.config</code> may not set a value higher
than the global limit (if configured). In other words, it is only honored when
it further reduces the global limit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When <a href="config-gerrit.html#receive.inheritProjectMaxObjectSizeLimit">
<code>receive.inheritProjectmaxObjectSizeLimit</code></a> is enabled in the global config,
the value is inherited from the parent project. Otherwise, it is not inherited
and must be explicitly set per project.</p>

<p>By default Gerrit checks the validity of git objects. Setting this variable to
false should not be used unless a project with history containing invalid
objects needs to be pushed into a Gerrit repository.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This functionality is provided as some other git implementations have allowed
bad history to be written into git repositories. If these repositories need pushing

<p>Controls whether a check for implicit merges will be performed when changes are
pushed for review. An implicit merge is a case where merging an open change
would implicitly merge another branch into the target branch. Typically, this
happens when a change is done on master and, by mistake, pushed to a stable branch
for review. When submitting such change, master would be implicitly merged into
stable without anyone noticing that. When this option is set to 'true' Gerrit
will reject the push if an implicit merge is detected.</p>

<p>The <code>create-new-change-for-all-not-in-target</code> option provides a
convenience for selecting <a href="user-upload.html#base">the merge base</a>

create new changes for all commits not in the target branch.</p>
</div>

<p>This option is disabled if the tip of the push is a merge commit.</p>

<p>This option also only works if there are no merge commits in the
commit chain, in such cases it fails warning the user that such
pushes can only be performed by manually specifying
<a href="user-upload.html#base">bases</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This option is useful if you want to push a change to your personal

<h3 id="branchOrder-section">branchOrder section</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Defines a branch ordering which is used for backporting of changes.
Backporting will be offered for a change (in the Gerrit UI) for all
more stable branches where the change can merge cleanly.</p>
</div>

<p>A branch name, typically multiple values will be defined. The order of branch
names in this section defines the branch order. The topmost is considered to be
the least stable branch (typically the master branch) and the last one the
most stable (typically the last maintained release branch).</p>

<p>The <code>branchOrder</code> section is inheritable. This is useful when multiple or all
projects follow the same branch rules. A <code>branchOrder</code> section in a child
project completely overrides any <code>branchOrder</code> section from a parent i.e. there
is no merging of <code>branchOrder</code> sections. A present but empty <code>branchOrder</code>
section removes all inherited branch order.</p>
</div>

<p>Branches not listed in this section will not be included in the mergeability
check. If the <code>branchOrder</code> section is not defined then the mergeability of a
change into other branches will not be done.</p>

<p>In order to reference a group in project.config, it must be listed in
the groups file.  When editing permissions through the web UI this
file is maintained automatically, but when pushing updates to
refs/meta/config this must be dealt with by hand.  Gerrit will refuse
project.config files that refer to groups not listed in groups.</p>

<p>The UUID of a group can be found on the General tab of the group&#8217;s page
